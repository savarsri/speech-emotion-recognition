# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion. This project attempts to use deep learning to recognize the emotions from data.
